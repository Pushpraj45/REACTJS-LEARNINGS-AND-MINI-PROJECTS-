jab bhi hume koi bhi data child ko pass karna hota hai to hum props ka use karte hai aur vo ek hirerichal 
level mein jata hai sam foor recieving the data from child, so it makes hard to get agai and again and here comes redux in the picture 
Redux provides a store as a solution. A store is a place where you can store all your application state together 
isse kisi component ko koi issue nahi hoti hai vo keval state ko answer karta hai vice versa
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux 
store have different slices to store messages of different types 
reducers ka kaam hota hai state ko update karna based upon the action passed 
action.payload ke andar data pass karna hota hai 
provider before app in index.js with configuring the store 
useDispatch is used to dispatch the state data 
redux dev tool extension download 
createSlices() creates two things for us reducers(register with store) and actions(export only)
