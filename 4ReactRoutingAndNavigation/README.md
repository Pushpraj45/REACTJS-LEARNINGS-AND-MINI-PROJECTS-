## Installation

To use the code and examples provided in this repository, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the command npm install to install the project dependencies.

## React Routing

React routing allows you to create multiple pages or views within a React application. It helps manage the URL and enables seamless navigation between different components. Understanding React routing is crucial for building complex web applications.

In this repository, you will find a basic example that demonstrates how to set up routing in a React application. You can find the code in the src/components/routing directory.

## DOM Manipulation

DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation is an essential part of building web applications. React provides various methods and APIs to interact with the DOM. Understanding how to manipulate the DOM using React will allow you to dynamically update your application's UI and respond to user interactions effectively.

In this repository, you will find examples showcasing how to manipulate the DOM using React. The code for these examples is located in the src/components/dom directory.

## Navigation

Navigation is a crucial aspect of any web application. In React, navigation can be achieved with the help of routing libraries. Understanding how to navigate between different pages or views in a React application is essential for building user-friendly interfaces.

In this repository, you will find examples demonstrating how to implement navigation using React routing. The code for these examples is located in the src/components/navigation directory.

## Examples

This repository includes several examples to help you grasp the concepts of React routing, DOM manipulation, and navigation. Each example is contained in its respective directory within the src/components folder.

To run the examples, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Run the command npm start to start the development server.
3. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the examples in action.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the examples provided.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
